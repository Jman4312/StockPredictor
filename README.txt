## Description
This code uses the last 60 days of a stock to predict the overnight change in the stock price.  It is not investment advice and it's just a fun project to do with machine learning using real data, and it's a great way to learn how to interface with yahoo's finance API.

## Instructions
First, install python on your computer.  Then go to where you have python installed and run:
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install pandas
pip install pandas-datareader
pip install sklearn
pip install tensorflow

Now you have all your required files! Nice!  Go ahead and pull the code from StockChangePredictor.py and run it, and it should work like a charm.  If you want to check another stock then change the ticker.

Future Improvements:
-Accept different input formats for the stock ticker
-Error Handling
-Deploying in the cloud
