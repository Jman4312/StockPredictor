First, install python on your computer.  Then go to where you have python installed and run:
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install pandas
pip install pandas-datareader
pip install sklearn
pip install tensorflow

Now you have all your required files! Nice!  Go ahead and pull the code from StockChangePredictor.py and run it, and it should work like a charm.  If you want to check another stock then change the ticker.
